Project: Command Line Parser

Objective: 
The idea behind the projects is to automate the process of command line parsing.

Progress:
Upto now, the user only has to provide the long options array and does not need
to handle all the shortopts in the switch cases,that part is been taken care of in
this project so far. Later in the program the user can access the arguments for the
options, by using the two methods(get_optarg_by_longopt/shortopt) provided by this library.
